:::warning Potential performance regression — under investigation

We're investigating a potential throughput regression affecting recent releases. Correctness and error rates are not affected. We're still confirming which versions are impacted and a fix — we'll update this note as soon as we have them. For throughput-sensitive workloads, we recommend validating performance in a staging environment before rolling out an upgrade.

`v1.89.3` is a patch release on top of [`v1.89.2`](/release_notes/v1.89.2/v1-89-2). It backports guardrail correctness fixes (a single pre-call hook for model-level guardrails, no DB re-init on every poll, 400 instead of 500 when AIM blocks a request) and caps Anthropic cache-control injection at the 4-block limit.

### What's Changed

- fix(integrations): cap Anthropic cache_control injection at 4 blocks - [PR #30480](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30480)
- fix(guardrails): run pre_call hook once for model-level guardrails - [PR #30543](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30543)
- fix(guardrails): stop re-initializing DB guardrails on every poll - [PR #30542](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30542)
- fix(guardrails): return 400 not 500 when AIM blocks a request - [PR #30573](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30573)
